<h2>Background of reproducibility in science</h2>
<br>
In recent years, the topic of reproducibility has risen in importance, as it is a tenant of the scientific method that is often disregarded.  Experiments have been done, finding that a large number of published research is ultimately not reproducible.  PLOS one investigated research done in the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields, finding that about 50% of respondents had encountered an incidence of non reproducible data.  Additionally, original authors are often uncooperative or impolite to communications from others attempting to reproduce their work.

Emphasis has been placed on being the first to publish, with pressures stemming from the need to be published in order to gain and secure both funding and recognition.  A recent development in biomedicine to combat this trend includes the Reproducibility Initiative, a forum to validate the results of anyone’s experiments.  Current proposals to combat reproducibilitiy are creating a “reproducibility index” for journals, random audits, and a Retraction Index, measuring the number of retractions a journal has for every 1000 papers published.  These initiatives keep the journals accountable for the papers that they publish, instead of putting all the blame on the scientists.
