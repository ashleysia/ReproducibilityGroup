Importance of Reproducibility
========================
Reproducibility "is the ability of an entire experiment or study to be reproduced, either by the researcher or by someone else working independently. It is one of the main principles of the scientific method and relies on ceteribus paribus‚Äù (Wikipedia). To test for repoducibility, other individuals must be able to take primary materials used in an experiment, project, research study, etc. and re-create the results.

Reproducibility is especially important in data science and research as it is a method of proving the validity of acheived results.  Because multiple individuals, and even communities, can reproduce the findings of an experiment, project, etc., those results prove to be credible. The reproducibility of results also shows that they are not fabricated or due to accidental procedural error.
