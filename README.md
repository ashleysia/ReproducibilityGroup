Reproducibility Group
====================

Reproducibility Group for Stat 157 Data Science Fair

Covered material: https://github.com/amx01/Reproducibility-Poster_ILLUSTRATIONS
* Background on why reproducibility is important in science
* Background on whatâ€™s going on right now in science
* Experience in the class regarding reproducibility
* What tools do we use 

The Final Deliverable:
* We will combine the collaboration (class management) and reproducibility posters into one
* Collaboration on the left side, reproducibility on the right side, combination of the two in the middle
* Final product: tri-fold posterboard
* We are meeting at 9 PM at I-House to work on the poster. If you can make it, awesome! If you can't, we'll take care of it :)
